    <h2>Study Group</h2>
    <p>Social pressure can work as a great motivational tool!  The aim is to have as many people as possible working through the curriculum as possible. </p>

    <h4>Why?</h4>
    
    <p>It is easy to get bogged down with a problem when you are working alone.  Be it a small bug in your first week with HTML; downloading the correct software packages onto your computer; ideas or inspiration for a project to work on.  Chances are that someone has had the exact same problem as you, and if you can find that someone to speak things over with, it will make a big difference. </p>
    
    <h4>Where?</h4>
    
    <p>Bring your laptop, ideas, reasources & suggestions to our weekly co-working meet ups at <a href="http://clickspace.vn/map/">SpaceBar Cafe</a> in Tay Ho, which will help to build a small network of people all working toward the same goal.</p>
