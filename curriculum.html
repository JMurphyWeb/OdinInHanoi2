    <h2>The Curriculum</h2>

    <p><a href="">The Odin Project</a> was developed around a year ago, and makes use of a wide variety of free resources from around the web.  As far as I have found it is the most extensive online curriculum for learning web development of its kind.   </p>
      
      <p>A quick <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=the+odin+project">Google search</a> of <q>The Odin Project</q> will reveal a load of information and positive reviews of the project.  Due to its popularity, there will also be a wealth of information and support available from people who have already finished or are in the process of working their way through it.</p>

    <p>Needless to say there is a LOT of content in there. It will take a lot of time and a lot of motivation.  That is why I am making this site to reach out to anyone else who is interested in attacking this beast as a group.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Is it for you?</h4>
    <p>If you are a total beginner and wondering if it is for you, or if you want a measure of how motivated you truly are, I would recommend taking the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">CodeCademy HTML/CSS</a> course which claims to be 7 hours long. It will take more...</p>  
      
    <p>Take notes in a Word document, practice new code on CodePen.com (a website that allows you to build simple websites and instantly check how they look).  Hopefully you will enjoy it. The Odin Project has you complete this course in one of its early lessons anyway.</p>
    
    <p>This basic website was built using what I learnt from that course.</p>
