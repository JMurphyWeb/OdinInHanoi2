    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are a couple of Hanoi based teachers with no past experience in coding, but with a common desire to learn about web development.</p>
    
    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>Join us as we learn all about full stack web development. From scratch. For free.  Our aim is to have learnt and practiced enough to be job ready within 6 months to 1 year.</p>

    <p>We have recently found an online <a href="curriculum.html">curriculum</a>, which makes use of a huge number of free online courses/lectures/documents and goes about teaching a total beginner enough to be job ready.  We have just started the course, it has been a blast so far and we wanted to spread the word and form a study group in Hanoi.

    <p>Personally I have no past experience in web/computers/design, but am confident that if I am part of an active study group and with the wealth of online support available, I will be able to achieve my goal of finishing the course by December 2015.

    <p>So far, people taking the course right now, in Hanoi, range in skill and experience with computers. Motivation for taking part in the course include: 
    <ul>
      <li>Career change</li>
      <li>Opening up additional career options</li>
      <li>Personal projects</li>
      <li>Personal interest</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whatever your motivation, if you have ever had an inclination to learn how to build websites, then this could be a perfect opportunity.
